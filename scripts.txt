1. Magnesium (Mg2+):
   Target Range: 1.5-2.5 mg/dL

2. Phosphate (PO4-):
   Target Range: 2.5-4.5 mg/d

3. Potassium (K+):
   Target Range: 3.5-5.0 mEq/L

4. Sodium (Na+):
   Target Range: 135-145 mEq/L

5. Calcium (Ca2+):
   Target Range: 8.4-10.2 mg/dL

6. Blood Flow Rate:
   Target Range: Typically around 200-500 mL/min, depending on the patient's vascular access.

7. Dialysate Flow Rate:
   Target Range: Usually around 500 mL/min

8. Urea (Blood Urea Nitrogen - BUN):
   Target Range: 10-20 mg/dL (may vary based on individual patient factors).

9. Creatinine:
   Target Range: 0.6-1.2 mg/dL (may vary based on individual patient factors).

10. Hemoglobin:
    Target Range: 11-12 g/dL (individualized based on patient characteristics).

11. Blood Pressure:
    Target Range: Pre-dialysis systolic BP <140 mm Hg, post-dialysis BP may drop but should not decrease excessively.

12. Heart Rate:
    Target Range: Generally within the patient's normal range. Significant variations may require further assessment.

13. Body Weight:
    Target Range: Weight loss during dialysis session should be monitored and managed. Rapid fluid removal can lead to complications.

14. Temperature:
    Target Range: Generally within the normal body temperature range (37).

15. Oxygen Saturation:
    Target Range: Maintained within normal levels (>95%).

These parameters should make up the parameters that will produce a patients monthly dialysis report.

However when the patient goes for dialysis sessions which is twice a week. The nurse at the triage should enter the only the following;
 1. Hemoglobin
 2. Body Weight
 3. Blood Pressure
 4. Temperature
 5. Oxygen Saturation.

When the patient leaves the clinic after the 4hr dialysis session, the nurse should enter the following information
 1. Body weight
 2. Blood Pressure.
